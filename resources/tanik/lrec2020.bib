    abstract = "We present ScholarlyRead, span-of-word-based scholarly articles{'} Reading Comprehension (RC) dataset with approximately 10K manually checked passage-question-answer instances. ScholarlyRead was constructed in semi-automatic way. We consider the articles from two popular journals of a reputed publishing house. Firstly, we generate questions from these articles in an automatic way. Generated questions are then manually checked by the human annotators. We propose a baseline model based on Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BiDAF) network that yields the F1 score of 37.31{\%}. The framework would be useful for building Question-Answering (QA) systems on scientific articles.",
